What, you may ask, is Democritus?

Democritus (the project) can be viewed as a **code library**, a **movement**, and a **statement**.

First, it is a **code library** containing simple, well tested, well documented functions.

The Democritus project is also a **movement**; a collection of people, if you will, who want to get more out of life and the world around them and want to use computers more effectively to this end.

The Democritus project is also a **statement**; a declaration that programming doesn't (and shouldn't!) be a frustrating black-hole. Computers should help us think, not force us to waste time thinking about things we don't care about.
